## üìê Detailed Usage Instructions

### Body Selection
- **Supported Types:** Solid bodies, surface bodies
- **Requirements:** Body must be a single, continuous object
- **Size Limits:** Maximum 100cm in any dimension
- **Validation:** Plugin checks for valid geometry automatically

### Slice Thickness Configuration
- **Minimum Thickness:** 0.01cm (0.1mm)
- **Maximum Thickness:** 10cm
- **Units:** Uses current Fusion document units
- **Smart Calculation:** Plugin calculates optimal slice count
- **Warnings:** Alerts for very thin slices or excessive slice counts

### Axis Selection (Pro)
- **Z-Axis (Horizontal):** Slices parallel to XY plane
- **X-Axis (Vertical):** Slices parallel to YZ plane  
- **Y-Axis (Vertical):** Slices parallel to XZ plane
- **Visual Preview:** Shows slice direction in dialog
- **Automatic Orientation:** Respects current component orientation

### Naming Conventions
**Trial Version:**
- Format: `[BodyName]_Slice_01`, `[BodyName]_Slice_02`, etc.
- Automatic numbering with zero-padding
- No customization options

**Pro Version:**
- **Custom Prefix:** Choose your own naming pattern
- **Smart Numbering:** Automatic sequential numbering
- **Pattern Examples:**
  - `LaserCut_Part_01`, `LaserCut_Part_02`
  - `Section_A_01`, `Section_A_02`
  - `Custom_Name_001`, `Custom_Name_002`

## üîß Advanced Features (Pro Only)

### Timeline Organization
The Pro version automatically creates organized timeline groups:
- **Group Name:** Based on original body name
- **Chronological Order:** Slices organized sequentially
- **Easy Management:** Expand/collapse groups for clean timeline
- **Batch Operations:** Apply changes to entire slice groups

### Multi-Axis Slicing Strategies

**Z-Axis (Horizontal) - Best For:**
- Laser cutting applications
- Layer-based manufacturing
- Flat sheet material preparation
- Traditional horizontal slicing

**X-Axis (Vertical Width) - Best For:**
- Side-view cross-sections
- Profile cutting
- Width-based segmentation
- Architectural sections

**Y-Axis (Vertical Depth) - Best For:**
- Front/back sectioning
- Depth-based analysis
- Longitudinal cuts
- Engineering cross-sections

### Thickness Optimization Tips
- **Laser Cutting:** Match material thickness (3mm, 6mm, etc.)
- **3D Printing:** Consider layer height multiples
- **CNC Machining:** Account for tool access and material waste
- **Assembly:** Plan for joining methods and tolerances

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**"Body selection is invalid"**
- Ensure you've selected a valid solid or surface body
- Check that body is not part of a component assembly
- Verify body has proper closed geometry

**"Slice thickness too small"**
- Minimum thickness is 0.01cm (0.1mm)
- Increase thickness value
- Check document units and scale

**"Too many slices calculated"**
- Trial version: Reduce thickness or upgrade to Pro
- Pro version: Confirm intention for large slice count
- Consider body size vs. thickness ratio

**"Slicing operation failed"**
- Check body geometry for errors
- Ensure adequate system memory
- Try simpler geometry or fewer slices

**F1 Help not working**
- Ensure internet connection is active
- Check firewall settings for browser access
- Try refreshing the help page

### Performance Optimization
- **Close unnecessary applications** before large slicing operations
- **Save your work** before running complex slicing
- **Use Preview mode** to verify settings before execution
- **Consider batch processing** for multiple bodies
